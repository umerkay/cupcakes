      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        Last Updated December 4, 2020 Please review these Terms of Use
        carefully. IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION
        PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 20 BELOW, REQUIRES THE
        USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. THIS
        MEANS THAT YOU AND THE WALMART ENTITIES ARE EACH GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO
        SUE EACH OTHER IN COURT OR IN CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION,
        THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE
        REVIEW THAN IN COURT.

        Welcome to the family of websites and applications provided by Walmart.
        These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of all Walmart Sites
        among other things. By using the Walmart Sites, you affirm that you are
        of legal age to enter into these Terms of Use, or, if you are not, that
        you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into these Terms
        of Use and your parent or guardian consents to these Terms of Use on
        your behalf. If you violate or do not agree to these Terms of Use, then
        your access to and use of the Walmart Sites is unauthorized. Additional
        terms and conditions apply to some services offered on the Walmart Sites
        (e.g., Walmart Pharmacy, and Gift Cards) or through other channels.
        Those terms and conditions can be found where the relevant service is
        offered on the Walmart Sites or otherwise and are incorporated into
        these Terms of Use by reference.
